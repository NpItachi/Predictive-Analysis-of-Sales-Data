This project involves predictive analysis of sales data using the Superstore Sales dataset from Kaggle.

**Description**

This project involves predictive analysis of sales data using the Superstore Sales dataset from Kaggle. The project aims to provide insights into the sales trends and predict future sales and profit using a linear regression model. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover important patterns and relationships in the data, followed by model building to forecast future outcomes.

The main focus of the project is to assist businesses in understanding key sales drivers and maximizing profitability by leveraging historical sales data.

**Features**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes the data to identify sales trends, patterns, and correlations.

Predictive Modeling: Uses linear regression to predict sales and profit based on historical data.

Data Visualization: Visual representation of sales data to enhance insights.

**Technologies Used**

Python programming language.

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Scikit-learn for building the linear regression model.
